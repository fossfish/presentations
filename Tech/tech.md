# Our<span class="fish"> IoT World</span>

<br />
<br />

* IoT want to be pervasive, ubiquitous
* Adoption driven by feature and cost
* Cheap hardware ! cheap software ?

<br />
<div style="text-align: center">
How? Open Source Software !
</div>

---

# Open<span class="fish">Source</span>

<br />
<div style="text-align: center">
Cheap ? No so fast !
</div>

* Compliance
* Secure boot
* Robust update
* Remote management
* Optimization
* Automated testing
* ...

---

# Let's <span class="fish">Collaborate</span>

<br />

* That is what infrastructure is for !
* Reuse Open Source components
* Easy, upstream your patch and move fast...
* Everyone does that just fine, right ?

---


# Is that your company <span class="fish">Job</span>  ?

---

# It is <span class="fish">Not</span> !

* Building hardware is <span class=fish>hard</span> enough
* Building software is <span class=fish>hard</span> too !
* Building your service is where you want to spend <span class="fish">your</span> time !
* Still, today, your engineer need to do all of this things : compliance, security, update, platform optimization...
* What if they could just work on their application like they do when working on a website ?

---

# New <span class="fish">infrastructure</span> !

* Linux
* Connectivity (Wireless, Bluetooth, 3/4G, ...)
* User interface toolkit
* Device management API
* High level language (Javascript) with easy to get extentions !
* Peer to peer communication infrastructure !

---

# <span class="fish">NIH</span>, no  !

---

# Linux <span class="fish">Distribution</span>

* Pick one, optimize it !
* IoT today, are the computer of yesterday !
* Require a bit of qemu porting
* Pick upstream open source project that are performance driven !
* Move to a robust firmware update mecanism
* Fast release cycle

---

# Connectivity<span class="fish"> !</span>

* Provide daemon to manage all of them
* Provide API for application to manipulate them
* Internet access built in
* Discoverability built in
* Peer2Peer built in

---

# User <span class="fish">interface</span> toolkit

* Desktop class
* Customizable to your needs !
* Touch, internationalization support
* Fast and light for IoT constrains

---

# Device <span class="fish">management</span>

* Robust firmware update
* Independent application update
* Alpha, beta and A/B testing
* Peer2Peer
* Remote connection for diagnostic
* Health report

---

# High level <span class="fish">language</span> !

* Javascript
* Compatible with all node.js JavaScript package
* Full system access
* Low memory profile
* Heavy task done natively by the platform

---

# Peer to <span class="fish">peer</span> native

* Scalability
* Robustness
* Low cost of operation
* Modern stack (Blockchain, IPFS)

---

# Longer <span class="fish">term</span>

* Provide proper financial incentive via blockchain to every contributor of the stack.
